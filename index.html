        <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>
  <p style="text-indent:2em;">
    I'm glad to come to my website. First of all, let me make a simple self introduction. My name is Lin Jixiang. I come from Ningbo, a beautiful city in Zhejiang Province. I am a student of Ningbo City Vocational and technical college. My major is computer application technology.</p>
    



<p style="text-indent:2em;">Well, my greatest advantage is my self-study ability and independence in solving problems. I work hard and am responsible for my work.</p>



<p style="text-indent:2em;">As we all know, in the field of it, technology updates very quickly. It is difficult and unnecessary for us to master all this. Therefore, the ability to learn quickly is very important.</p>



<p style="text-indent:2em;">When it comes to independence, it doesn't mean that I don't want to communicate with others, but that I'm good at solving problems independently. For example, when I encounter a difficult technical problem, first I will use all the relevant tools at hand, such as Google or library books, to solve it. I won't ask for help from others at the beginning unless I try to solve it myself.</p>



<p style="text-indent:2em;">As for the sense of responsibility, I try to form the habit of considering all aspects of my work, analyze the advantages and disadvantages, ensure that there are no problems, and be responsible for the work I need to complete. My goal is to make everything go as planned. I will never give up.</p>
        



<p style="text-indent:2em;">I have many hobbies. I like sports, especially badminton. I play badminton at least twice a week. Lin Dan is one of my favorite badminton players. Music is also my favorite. Similarly, I basically listen to a lot of songs every day, because music can relax myself.
